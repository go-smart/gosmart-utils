@article{Trujillo2013,
abstract = {Abstract Purpose: Although theoretical modelling is widely used to study different aspects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA), its utility is directly related to its realism. An important factor in this realism is the use of mathematical functions to model the temperature dependence of thermal (k) and electrical ($\sigma$) conductivities of tissue. Our aim was to review the piecewise mathematical functions most commonly used for modelling the temperature dependence of k and $\sigma$ in RFA computational modelling. Materials and methods: We built a hepatic RFA theoretical model of a cooled electrode and compared lesion dimensions and impedance evolution with combinations of mathematical functions proposed in previous studies. We employed the thermal damage contour D63 to compute the lesion dimension contour, which corresponds to $\Omega$ = 1, $\Omega$ being local thermal damage assessed by the Arrhenius damage model. Results: The results were very similar in all cases in terms of impedance evolution and lesion size after 6 min of ablation. Although the relative differences between cases in terms of time to first roll-off (abrupt increase in impedance) were as much as 12\%, the maximum relative differences in terms of the short lesion (transverse) diameter were below 3.5\%. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the different methods of modelling temperature dependence of k and $\sigma$ reported in the literature do not significantly affect the computed lesion diameter.},

abstract = {Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is a minimally invasive method for treatment of primary and metastatic liver tumors. One of the currently commercially available devices employs an internally cooled 17-gauge needle probe. Within the probe, cool water is circulated during ablation, which cools tissue close to the probe resulting in larger lesions. We evaluated the effect of different cooling water temperatures on lesion size. We created a finite-element method model, simulated 12 min impedance-controlled ablation and determined temperature distribution for three water temperatures. Lesion diameters in the model were 33.8, 33.4, and 32.8 mm for water temperatures of 5 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 25 degrees C, respectively. We solved a simplified model geometry analytically and present dependence of lesion diameter on cooling temperature. We further performed ex vivo experiments in fresh bovine liver. We created four lesions for each water temperature, with the same water temperatures as used in the finite-element method (FEM) model. Average lesion diameters were 28.3, 30, and 29.5 mm for water temperatures of 5 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 25 degrees C, respectively. Water temperature did not have a significant effect on lesion size in the ex vivo experiments (p = 0.76), the FEM model, and the analytical solution.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To study the relationship between roll-off (sudden increase in impedance) and spatial distribution of dehydrated tissue during RF ablation using a cooled electrode (temperatures around 100°C). METHODS: We used a double approach: (1) theoretical modelling based on the finite element method, and (2) 20 ablations using an experimental study on ex vivo excised bovine liver in which we measured impedance progress and temperature at three points close to the electrode surface: 0.5 (T1), 1.5 (T2) and 2.5 (T3) mm from the tip. T2 was located exactly at the centre of the 30 mm long electrode. RESULTS: Temperatures at T1 and T3 quickly rose to 100°C (at ≈20 and 40 s, respectively), while at the rise at T2 was somewhat slower, stabilized around 50 s and reached a maximum value of 99°C at about 60 s. Impedance reached a minimum of 65 $\Omega$ (plateau), began increasing at 50 s and continued rising throughout the procedure, reaching a value equal to the initial value at 70 s. Likewise, computed impedance dropped to ≈73 $\Omega$ (plateau), began increasing at 50 s and reached an impedance value equal to the initial value at ≈78 s, which approximately coincided with the time when the entire zone surrounding the electrode was within the 100°C isotherm. CONCLUSION: There is a close relationship between the moment at which roll-off occurs and the time when the entire electrode is completely encircled by the dehydrated tissue. The mid-electrode zone is the last in which tissue desiccation occurs.},

abstract = {Microwaves are a promising source for thermal tumor ablation due to their ability to rapidly heat dispersive biological tissues, often to temperatures in excess of 100 °C. At these high temperatures, tissue dielectric properties change rapidly and, thus, so do the characteristics of energy delivery. Precise knowledge of how tissue dielectric properties change during microwave heating promises to facilitate more accurate simulation of device performance and helps optimize device geometry and energy delivery parameters. In this study, we measured the dielectric properties of liver tissue during high-temperature microwave heating. The resulting data were compiled into either a sigmoidal function of temperature or an integration of the time-temperature curve for both relative permittivity and effective conductivity. Coupled electromagnetic-thermal simulations of heating produced by a single monopole antenna using the new models were then compared to simulations with existing linear and static models, and experimental temperatures in liver tissue. The new sigmoidal temperature-dependent model more accurately predicted experimental temperatures when compared to temperature-time integrated or existing models. The mean percent differences between simulated and experimental temperatures over all times were 4.2\% for sigmoidal, 10.1\% for temperature-time integration, 27.0\% for linear and 32.8\% for static models at the antenna input power of 50 W. Correcting for tissue contraction improved agreement for powers up to 75 W. The sigmoidal model also predicted substantial changes in heating pattern due to dehydration. We can conclude from these studies that a sigmoidal model of tissue dielectric properties improves prediction of experimental results. More work is needed to refine and generalize this model.},

abstract = {The temperature distribution in the region near a microwave antenna is a critical factor that affects the entire temperature field during microwave ablation of tissue. It is challenging to predict this distribution precisely, because the temperature in the near-antenna region varies greatly. The effects of water vaporisation and subsequent tissue carbonisation in an ex vivo porcine liver were therefore studied experimentally and in simulations. The enthalpy and high-temperature specific absorption rate (SAR) of liver tissues were calculated and incorporated into the simulation process. The accuracy of predictions for near-field temperatures in our simulations has reached the level where the average maximum error is less than 5°C. In addition, a modified thermal model that accounts for water vaporisation and the change in the SAR distribution pattern is proposed and validated with experiment. The results from this study may be useful in the clinical practice of microwave ablation and can be applied to predict the temperature field in surgical planning.},
