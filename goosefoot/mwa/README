MITA models

This repository contains the code for running models of minimally
invasive tumour ablation.

Before doing anything the script install.sh should be executed.
This simply prepares the test cases.

In order to check the installation the script run_tests.sh can be
executed. This takes approximately 2 days at the moment and
generates a txt file containing the output.
